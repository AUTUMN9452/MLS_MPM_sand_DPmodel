# The application of MLS-MPM in geotechnical engineering (first try)
This project implemented the following papers:
The DP constitutive model refers to Professor Zhang Xiong:
Zhang X, Chen Z, Liu Y. The material point method: a continuum-based particle method for extreme loading cases[M]. Academic Press, 2016.

The calculation process is based on the MPM88 of Hu Yuanming:
Hu Y, Fang Y, Ge Z, et al. A moving least squares material point method with displacement discontinuity and two-way rigid body coupling[J]. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2018, 37(4): 1-14.
